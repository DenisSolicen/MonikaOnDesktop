1euc [player], do you get good sleep?
1ekc It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays.
1ekc Especially in high school, when you're forced to wake up so early every day...
1euc I'm sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more flexible schedule
4rsc Then again, I hear a lot of people in college stay up all night anyway, for no real reason
1euc Is that true?
1ekc Anyway, I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by lack of sleep
3ekc It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it
1ekc I just think you're really great and wanted to make sure you're not accidentally destroying yourself
1euc So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?
1huc I'll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own well-being before anything else

2hko Ahaha, sorry
1rkc Just forget I said anything

3euc Hey, what's your favorite color?
3euo Mine is emerald green
3huo It's the color of my eyes!
3rkc ...That's not conceited or anything, is it?
4euc I just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it
1euc Like it's part of my identity
1euc Does it happen to also be your favorite color, [player]?
1tku It's just a guess...
1tsc ...because you've been looking into my eyes for a while now
1huo E-he-he~

3euo Okay, everyone!
3euo It's time to...
2ekc I'm just kidding
2ekc I just used to really like saying that for some reason
2huo A-ha-ha!
2euc I couldn't help but say it again
2lsc Come to think of it, didn't Natsuki and Yuri make fun of me for it once?..
2euc Well, whatever
2euc It's not like you ever made fun of me
2ekc You're too much of a sweetheart to do that, aren't you?
5euc A-ha-ha~
=
3euc Hey, what's your favorite game?
3huc Mine is «Doki Doki Literature Club»!
1huo Ahaha! That was a joke
5euc Мне просто нравилось говорить это по какой-то причине
5euc But if you tell me you like some other романтика game better, I might get a little jealous~

4huo Watashi wa itsumademo anata no mono desu!
2hko Don't worry, [player]. The meaning is still the same
1euc I'm just practicing Japanese
3euc You know what that means, [player]?

1rsc Just kidding .. I'm just kidding ...
