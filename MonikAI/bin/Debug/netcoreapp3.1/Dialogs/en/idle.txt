1euc [player], do you get good sleep?
1ekc It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays.
1eka Especially in high school, when you're forced to wake up so early every day...
1euc I'm sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more flexible schedule
4rsc Then again, I hear a lot of people in college stay up all night anyway, for no real reason
1euc Is that true?
1ekc Anyway, I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by lack of sleep
3ekc It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it
1eka I just think you're really great and wanted to make sure you're not accidentally destroying yourself
1euc So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?
1huc I'll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own well-being before anything else

3euc Hey, what's your favorite color?
3euc Mine is emerald green
3huc It's the color of my eyes!
3rka ...That's not conceited or anything, is it?
4euc I just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it
1euc Like it's part of my identity
1euc Does it happen to also be your favorite color, [player]?
1tku It's just a guess...
1tsa ...because you've been looking into my eyes for a while now
1huc E-he-he~

3euc Okay, everyone!
3euc It's time to...
2eka I'm just kidding
2eka I just used to really like saying that for some reason
2huc A-ha-ha!
2euc I couldn't help but say it again
2lsc Come to think of it, didn't Natsuki and Yuri make fun of me for it once?..
2euc Well, whatever
2euc It's not like you ever made fun of me
2eka You're too much of a sweetheart to do that, aren't you?
5euc A-ha-ha~

3euc Hey, what's your favorite game?
